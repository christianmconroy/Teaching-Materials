    "\n",
    "#### Other machine learning frameworks and packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason you might want to look beyond scikit-learn is if you are\n",
    "more interested in statistical modeling and inference than prediction. In this case,\n",
    "you should consider the statsmodel package for Python, which implements several\n",

    "#### Ranking, recommender systems, time series, and other kinds of learning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two partic‐\n",
    "ularly important topics that we did not cover in this book. The first is ranking, in\n",
    "which we want to retrieve answers to a particular query, ordered by their relevance.\n",
    "You’ve probably already used a ranking system today; this is how search engines\n",
    "operate. You input a search query and obtain a sorted list of answers, ranked by how\n",

    "The other strategy for scaling is distributing the data over multiple machines in a\n",
